# Mobile Developer Internship Test
A test for those applying to the Mobile Developer Internship at HasGeek - hasjob.co/hasgeek.com/heomz

This is an Android based evaluation to test you ability to pick up something new.

This is a simple app to fetch the repositories of an organisation using the GitHub API with Retrofit and GSON and load it into a RecyclerView.
We will be using the simplest usecase of RxJava to achieve this.

I have setup the framework for the app already, you will need to fill out the parts where I am throwing a `RuntimeException` with a bit of a hint on what is needed there.

Please submit a Pull Request to this repository with a working version of the app.
